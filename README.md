# Document_Co-clustering_and_scRNA-seq_Clustering_to_Twitter

1. LDA and document_co-clustering: Traditional topic modeling schemes including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) have been widely adopted in the social sciences, but are typically unable to
cope well with short and noisy texts. Several document co-clustering algorithms have been proposed
as potential solutions, but their performances have seldom been compared systematically. Therefore,
the first task is to assess the effectiveness of existing document co-clustering
algorithms, using LDA as a baseline for comparison.
2.  scRNA-seq_clustering: In addition, we observe that microblog data such as Twitter data, once formatted as a word document
matrix, shares important properties with single-cell RNA sequencing data; in particular,
both types of data are high-dimensional, consist of small integer counts, and have sparse non-zero
entries. Moreover, there are several advanced clustering methods designed to identify cell types and
gene expression patterns, so a second task of this project is to apply single-cell RNA-seq
data clustering methods to Twitter data. We find that these methods have the ability to improve
document co-clustering analyses.
3. proposed_workflow: With the algorithms that show advantages in topic modeling for short texts, we develop
a pipeline that has a performance comparable to that of the hand-created classification but works
automatically and can be applied to general Twitter data sets.
