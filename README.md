# Document_Co-clustering_and_scRNA-seq_Clustering_to_Twitter

Traditional topic modeling schemes including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and LatentSemantic Analysis (LSA) have been widely adopted in the social sciences, but are typically unable to cope well with short and noisy texts. Several document co-clustering algorithms havebeen proposed as potential resolutions, but their performances have seldom been comparedsystematically. Here, we assess the effectiveness ofthe existing document co-clustering algorithms using LDA, one of the most commonly usedtopic modeling techniques, as a baseline for comparison. 

In addition, we observe that microblog data such as Twitter data, once formatted as aword-document matrix, shares important properties with single-cell RNA sequencing data; in particular, both types of data are high dimensional, consist of small integer counts, and havesparse non-zero entries. Moreover, there are several advanced clustering methods designed toidentify cell types and gene expression patterns, so we apply single-cell RNA-seq data clustering methods to Twitter data.
